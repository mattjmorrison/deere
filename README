This is the slide deck for my "Constantly Start Over, Never Rewrite"
talk for Iowa Code Camp 11.

This uses Jekyll to render a static html page that contains all of
the slides. The slides are done using reveal.js.

index.html takes care of wiring together the Jekyll pages with reveal.js.

The pages are ordered by name (so all start with a 2 digit number) and
grouped by name also (minus the leading 2 digit number and file extension).

Each 'group' of slides will using reveal.js's horizontal transition and the
slides within a group will use vertical transitions.
